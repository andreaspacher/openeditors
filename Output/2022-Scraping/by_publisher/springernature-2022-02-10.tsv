Springer Nature	Cell Death & Disease	NA	Boris Zhitovsky	"Sweden, Stockholm - Boris Zhivotovsky, PhD, Dr Sci, is Professor of Toxicology at the Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden). He received his PhD in 1975 (in the laboratory of Professor Kaido Hanson) and Dr Sci in Radiobiology and Biochemistry in 1989 in Leningrad (Soviet Union), with both studies investigating molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced death of lymphoid cells. The team was first to describe this phenomenon as an example of programmed cell death. In 1987 he received the USSR State Prize in Science and Technology for development of the theoretical basis of radiation-induced death of lymphoid cells and their use to determine the pathogenesis of radiation sickness. In 1991 he was invited to join Professor Sten Orrenius's group at Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm), where he became a group leader, Associate Professor, Professor, and from 2004 a Head of the Unit of Toxicology. In 2010 he was invited to build a new laboratory investigating apoptosis mechanisms at the Faculty of Basic Medicine, Moscow State University (Russia) and elected as a University Professor. He was first to describe intracellular localization and translocation of caspases, to show that microinjection of cytochrome c can kill cells, to understand that the resistance of small cell lung carcinoma cells and tumors to treatment is partly linked to the absence of expression of caspase-8 and -10, and to present evidence that mitotic catastrophe is not a separate mode of cell death but a process (""prestage"") preceding cell death, which can occur through necrosis, apoptosis or autophagy. His recent work is focusing on attempts to increase the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to treatment using regulation of cross-talk between various cell death modalities. He was an organizer of three Nobel Conferences on The Cell Cycle and Cell Death in Disease and several other meetings; received several awards including the Descartes Research Prize (EU Science Award); and was a General Secretary (1999-2007), President-Elect (2007-2010), and President (2010-2012) of the European Cell Death Organization (ECDO).

Springer Nature	Cell Death Discovery	NA	Xin Lu	UK, Oxford - Professor Xin Lu studied Biochemistry at Sichuan University and then Cancer Research at Peking Union Medical School in Beijing. She was awarded an IARC WHO fellowship to come to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London in 1986 and studied for her PhD under Birgit Lane. In 1993 she joined the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), St. Mary's Branch, Imperial College as an Assistant Member and was progressively promoted to LICR Full Member and Professor at Imperial College in 2000. In 2004, she was appointed as the Director of the LICR’s UCL Branch but moved the unit to Oxford in 2007. She is an elected Member of EMBO and Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Professor Lu's research is focused on understanding tumour suppression and to identify molecular switches that selectively kill cancer cells. Cancer is a disease where cells grow in the wrong place at the wrong time. Regenerative medicine involves growing cells to replace the ones that were lost or damaged. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms that control cell growth is vital, both to stop cancer cell growth and to grow normal cells to replace the damaged ones. Professor Lu's research team has been one of the major research groups in the world to study the regulation of the tumour suppressor function of the p53 protein whose function is lost in most human cancers. The majority of nuclear import pathways are mediated by importin-cargo interactions. Yet around 50% of all nuclear proteins do not use this pathway. Through a detailed understanding of the regulation of the ASPP proteins, Professor Lu's group has identified a code that defines RaDAR as a novel nuclear import pathway of ankyrin repeats (AR) containing proteins. AR is a structural motif found in over 250 human proteins with diverse functions. The RaDAR (RanGDP/AR) pathway is acquired by the most common familial melanoma associated CDKN2A mutation, leading to nuclear accumulation of mutant p16ink4a. It is frequently used by AR-containing transcriptional regulators, especially those regulating NF-ĸB/p53. All these suggest the existence of an Ankyrin repeats signaling and its role in infection and cancer.

His work aims to understand the molecular basis of tumour suppression signalling with a particular focus on the role of p53 family members, microenvironmental hypoxia and metabolic alterations. His training started at the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy) where in 2011 he received the PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, elucidating a novel microRNA-mediated mechanism regulating the balance of epidermal cell proliferation/differentiation. His research activity then continued at the MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Cambridge (UK), where in 2016 he received the appointment of Senior Investigator Scientist. His major contributions include the identification of specific functions for p53 family members in cellular stress response, mediated by p73 regulation of cancer metabolism , angiogenesis, and development. More recently, he revealed a novel gain-of-function effect of p53 mutants in hypoxic tumours. Ivano is a member of the board of directors of the European Cell Death Organisation (ECDO) and member of a number of international advisory boards.

Springer Nature	Nature Plants	NA	Senior Editor: Guillaume Tena	A long time ago, in a faraway country, Guillaume was sitting at a bench, with a scalpel in his hand. It was during a university practical training session in biology. He was looking at a frog, and the frog was looking at him. Something happened. Right there, very suddenly, he decided once and for all that he would not study animal biology. The frog escaped alive, and Guillaume escaped towards a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Montpellier, France, working on auxin and MAP kinases in tobacco cells. As a post-doc, he spent fourteen years in Boston, USA, in Jen Sheen’s lab at Harvard / MGH, to study the involvement of MAP kinases in plant defence signalling and abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. He then realized that he just spent almost half of his life working on MAP kinases, and he decided he would never write this word again in his biography. Back in France for a year, he enrolled in a Master in Scientific Communications at the University of Strasbourg, and officialised his escape from the bench by joining the editorial team at Nature Plants in London, UK.	https://www.nature.com/nplants/editors	2022-02-10

Springer Nature	Oncogenesis	NA	Jan Paul Medema, Laboratory of Experimental Oncology and Radiobiology (LEXOR), University of Amsterdam, Netherlands	Jan Paul Medema studied Chemistry in Leiden, the Netherlands, graduating in 1991 with a specialisation in biochemistry and medical biochemistry. He continued his training under the guidance of Professor Hans Bos at the Univeristy of Utrecht and received his PhD in 1996 on the topic of the oncoprotein p21Ras. He then went on to study the role of programmed cell death in tumor biology and immunology in order to understand the basic concepts of cell death signalling and the way these are perturbed in cancer. He unravelled several modes of cell death escape, specifically in the face of a cytotoxic immune response. Later, his work moved into the direction of cancer heterogeneity and its role in cell death resistance, tumor growth and therapy response, centering around the role of cancer stem cells in these processes, as well as the role of inter-patient heterogeneity in the aggressiveness of tumors. Currently, Professor Medema is the Head of the Laboratory of Experimental Oncology and Radiobiology (LEXOR) in the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, which has developed several research lines focusing on the mechanisms of survival/cell death resistance of tumor cells against therapeutic interventions.	https://www.nature.com/oncsis/editors	2022-02-10
Springer Nature	Oncogenesis	NA	Maarten Bijlsma, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands	Maarten Bijlsma received his master’s degree in molecular biology from the University of Amsterdam in 2002. His PhD studies at the Medicine Faculty of that same university centered on the contributions and mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in development, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. He received his doctorate in 2008 and then, supported by KWF Dutch Cancer Society fellowship, did his postdoctoral research in the lab of Henk Roelink at UC Berkeley. Here, he further investigated Hedgehog signaling in development and cancer, discovering several previously unrecognized paradigms and mechanisms in this signaling pathway. Since 2010, he is a group leader at the Amsterdam UMC, location AMC, where his group works on pancreatic and esophageal cancer, cancers that depend on tumor-stroma interaction and are suspected to at least in part be driven by aberrant Hedgehog signaling. The research in his group ranges from cell biology, translational work including biomarker development, delineation of intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, to the design of clinical studies with collaborators from clinical departments.	https://www.nature.com/oncsis/editors	2022-02-10
